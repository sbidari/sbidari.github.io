<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />

<div>
I am currently a doctoral candidate in Applied Mathematics at University of Colorado Boulder working with <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/amath/zpkilpat">Dr. Zachary Kilpatrick </a>. I am interested in study of collective behaviour, group organization and decision making in animal groups using mathematical frameworks. I expect to graduate with a Ph.D in spring of 2022 and am looking out for a post doc opportunity in related areas.
