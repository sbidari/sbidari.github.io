<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />

I just defended my thesis studying group decisions and collective behavior working with Dr. Zachary Kilpatrick in Applied Mathematics department at University of Colorado Boulder. I am starting a Post Doc position with Dr. Wan Yang at Columbia University this summer to study epidemic dynamics using dynamical modeling and statistical inference.
