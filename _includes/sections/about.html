<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />

<div>
I am currently a doctoral candidate in Applied Mathematics at University of Colorado Boulder working with <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/amath/zpkilpat">Dr. Zachary Kilpatrick </a>. I study collective behaviour, group organization and decision making in animal groups using data to bolster the models. I expect to graduate with a Ph.D in spring of 2022 and be on the job market summer/fall 2022.
